# Introduction

I created this Counter using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

## How to use

The counter is simple to use.

Press the increase button to add 1, and the decrease button to remove 1 from the counter.

If the counter is more than 1 it will change to lightgreen, if it is less than 1 it will change to red, if it is 0 it will change to whitesmoke.
