# Introduction

I created this Counter using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

## How to use

The counter is simple to use.

Press the increase button to add 1, and the decrease button to remove 1 from the counter.

If the counter is more than 1 it will change to lightgreen, if it is less than 1 it will change to red, if it is 0 it will change to whitesmoke.

## Technology I used

I used HTML and CSS, using my own style sheets (no framework).

I used JavaScript for the functionality.

The main aspects were adding an event listener to the two buttons, using them to decrease and increase the counter, and then using the if else statements to change the colour based on whether it is more than 0, equal to 0, or less than 0.
